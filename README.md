# Fraction Bingo
An educational math web game for K-12 students in the form of bingo with three problem modes and difficulty levels written in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I developed this in 2020 for TeCanal, a nonprofit organization dedicated to providing STEM education to underserved communities through an online platform featuring educational games.
